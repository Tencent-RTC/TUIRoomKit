>! This component uses two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud: [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047). When you activate TRTC, IM will be activated automatically. For information about the billing of IM, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

### Step 2: Download the source code and configure the project
1. Clone or download the source code in our repository (**You can start the repository to save it**).
2. Find and open `Web/vue3/src/config/basic-info-config.js`.
3. Configure parameters in `basic-info-config.js`:

	- SDKAPPID: 0 by default. Set it to the `SDKAppID` obtained in step 1.
	- SECRETKEY: '' by default. Set it to the key obtained in step 1.

### Step 3: Run the example

1. install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd TUIRoom/Web/vue3
   
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the sample project in the development environment

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Generate a DIST file

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
### Step 4. Try out the demo

Open `http://localhost:3000/#/home` in a browser to try out TUIRoom.

Because Element Plus components are imported manually, it may take a relatively long time for the page to load in the development environment for the first time. This will not be an issue after building.

**Anchor (userId: anchor)**

- 1. On the home page, click **New Room**.
- 2. Enter a room.

### Step 5: Production Environment Deployment
- 1. Generate a DIST file

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
- 2. Deploy the dist file to the server

>! Production environments require the use of https domains

## FAQs

### I deployed the demo project in the testing/development environment. The mic and camera did not work. What should I do?
